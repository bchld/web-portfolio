        <p>I'm learning software development in Nashville, Tn.</p>
        <p>A few reasons I want to learn this skill are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy problem solving</li>
            <li>To prove to myself I can learn a new skill</li>
            <li>Software development is an in demand skill</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>About Britt</h3>
        <p>I dropped out of college to pursue music full time and was lucky enough to play some incredible stages with many of my favorite bands. Ultimately, I wanted to start a family
            and the musician life made that very difficult. Music retail seemed like the best way to earn a living away from the road and that's what I've been doing for the past 15 years.
        </p>

        <p>One of the roles I had was in operations and logistics. Our company needed some tools and I started dabbling in coding to help build what was needed. I enjoyed the process
            so much that I left my job and decided to pursue software development full time at Thinkful!
