        <h2>About Britt</h2>
        <p>I dropped out of college to pursue music full time and was lucky enough to play some incredible stages with many of my favorite bands. Ultimately, I wanted to start a family
            and the musician life made that very difficult. Music retail seemed like the best way to earn a living away from the road and that's what I've been doing for the past 15 years.
        </p>

        <p>One of the roles I had was in operations and logistics. Our company needed some tools and I started dabbling in coding to help build what was needed. I enjoyed the process
            so much that I left my job and decided to pursue software development full time at Thinkful!
